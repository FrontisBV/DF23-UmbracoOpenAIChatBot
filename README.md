Welcome to the official repository for the Umbraco and OpenAI chatbot integration session at Duugfest 2023!

## Session Description

In this session, we'll explore the powerful fusion of Umbraco and OpenAI Functions to create an AI-driven chatbot. Discover how the latest AI models can intelligently respond to user requests with JSON outputs, enabling dynamic content generation for Umbraco pages. We'll showcase the chatbot in action, demonstrating its ability to create pages on various topics.

### Module Features

- **Message History**: Message history is saved automatically.
- **Custom Storage Logic**: Message history available for custom storing logic.
- **Recursive OpenAI Calls**: OpenAI functions calls are handled recursively.
- **Extensibility**: Custom function calls can be added by adding a single file.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Chatbot GUI available.
- **Optimized Communication**: Automapper usage for downscaling the Umbraco models (Content & ContentType) to optimize tokenization, resulting in faster communication.

### Chatbot Umbraco Features

- **Retrieve Information**: Retrieve document type information and content item information.
- **Create Content**: Create content items (pages).
- **Update Content**: Update content items (pages).

### Current Limitations

- Document type permissions are not taken into account when creating pages.
- Multi-culture support is missing.
- Message history is saved into memory by default.
- Integration tests are not implemented.
- Injecting custom function calls is not yet supported.
- Builder pattern does not support custom configuration.
- Tokenization can grow beyond the token limits.
